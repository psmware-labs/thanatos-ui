## Opening the project in Visual Studio Code

Open Visual Studio Code (VSC), click _File -> Open Folder_, navigate to the folder containing the thanatos project, Click **Open**.

The project will load in VSC.

Once loaded, click on the small green Icon on the bottom left hand corner of the editor. ![Remote Icon](../img/vsc-icon.png)

This will make the remote select dropdown appear.

![Remote Icon](../img/vsc-remoteopen.png)

Chose **Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container**.

The project will now open in a docker container.

![Remote Icon](../img/vsc-opening.png)

The first time opening the container will take a while, as the required images need to be downloaded from the [Docker Image Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), to build the container.

The container will be fully loaded and ready to use when the icon in the bottom left switches from **↻ Opening Remote...** to **Dev Container: THANATOS**.

### Setting up the API and UI

On first run of, or after you rebuild, your container it is necessary to setup the UI and API. Thi can be done by opening a _Terminal Window_ in VSCode and running `setupApp` at the prompt.

## Working in your Development Environment

Below are common commands for working your development environment. There are three different development servers included in this project.

* The back-end REST API
* The Front-end UI
* The Documentation

### Backend REST API

The backend API is written in Python using the Django REST Framework. To start the development server, in a _Terminal Window_ in VSCode. Type `serve api`, this will start the REST API service, which can be accessed at `http://localhost:5000/` for development.

```nohighlight
╭─vscode@thanatos-ui /app  ‹develop›
╰─➤  serve api
Watching for file changes with StatReloader
Performing system checks...

System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
May 23, 2021 - 16:36:05
Django version 3.2.3, using settings 'main.settings'
Starting development server at http://0.0.0.0:5000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

The server will watch for any changes to code, and if valid, will incorporate the changes into the currently running service, which will allow for realtime provisioning of changes.  To quit the server, click on the terminal and press `ctrl-c` as mentioned above.

### Frontend UI

The frontend UI is written in React using TypeScript. To start the development server, in a _Terminal Window_ in VSCode. Type `serve ui`, this will start the React UI, which can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000/` for development.

```nohighlight
╭─vscode@thanatos-ui /app  ‹develop›
╰─➤  serve ui
Compiled successfully!

You can now view ui in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://172.21.0.4:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.
```

The server will watch for any changes to code, and if valid, will incorporate the changes into the currently running service, which will allow for realtime provisioning of changes. To quit the server, click on the terminal and press `ctrl-c`.

### Documentation

The documentation is written in using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org). This simple to use documentation style allows for ery flexible documenting for GitHub and documentations sites.  To start the development server which will alow you to see what your documentation will look like real-time, in a _Terminal Window_ in VSCode. Type `serve docs`, this will start the React UI, which can be accessed at `http://localhost:8000/` for development.

```nohighlight
╭─vscode@thanatos-ui /app  ‹develop›
╰─➤  serve docs                                                                                                                                             127 ↵

```

The server will watch for any changes to code, and if valid, will incorporate the changes into the currently running service, which will allow for realtime provisioning of changes.  To quit the server, click on the terminal and press `ctrl-c`.
